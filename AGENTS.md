# Repo Instructions

- The `p*/README.md` intentionally starts with `### p4-sandbox` followed by
  `## "Filters-only" Nushell sandbox with no external commands`. Keep this
  heading casing to avoid distracting from the tagline.

## Testing

`./scripts/check.sh`

All changes must pass these checks.

## Commits

Use **conventional commit messages** for all commits and PR titles (e.g.
`feat(nu): add new parser`, `fix(engine): resolve job deadlock`).
